Clean Architecture Implementation
The application will follow Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

Domain Layer (Core)

Business entities (User, Project, MoodBoard, Product, Supplier)
Business rules and logic
Interface definitions (repositories, services)
Use cases that represent application actions
Application Layer

Use case implementations
Service orchestration
Business logic coordination
No dependencies on external frameworks
Infrastructure Layer

Supabase client implementations
External API integrations
Authentication mechanisms
File storage implementations
Presentation Layer

Next.js pages and components
UI state management
User input handling
Shadcn UI components

Best Practices for Sustainable Codebase
Use interfaces to define contracts between layers
Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase
Implement dependency injection for better testability
Create feature modules rather than technical modules
Write comprehensive tests for each layer (unit, integration, e2e)
Document complex logic with inline comments
Use strict TypeScript to catch errors early
Create reusable components with well-defined props
Implement proper error handling across application boundaries
Establish coding standards and enforce with linting
